Navigation and path planning are critical components of developing robotic technology. Optimized path planning can improve efficiency and throughput of an industrial robotic manipulator. The path must be planned in a way that will avoid collisions with all obstacles and minimize trajectory path distance while satisfying jerk and other dynamic constraints. The environment is discretized into a grid to allow for easy definition of obstacles and waypoints. Curve fitting techniques are used to define a path around known obstacles in a static environment. A genetic algorithm is then used to optimize the path. The fitness is determined based on trajectory distance as well as proximity to an obstacle. Results are verified against results from a wavefront algorithm. This algorithm may be expanded to 3D problems with considerations on computational efficiency.
