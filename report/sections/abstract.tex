Navigation and path planning are critical components of developing robotic technology, where optimized path planning can improve efficiency and throughput of an industrial robotic manipulator. A genetic algorithm is used to plan a polynomial function based trajectory which avoids collisions with any obstacles and minimizes path distance and dynamic constraints. The stochastic nature of the genetic algorithm allows it to determine a viable and efficient path for a manipulator quickly as its environment changes. Algorithm results are verified by comparing with deterministic algorithms which produce the absolute best path.
