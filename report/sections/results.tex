As mentioned in section \ref{sec:experiment}, the following results were obtained through a test of 600 trials of running the genetic algorithm. Robot configuration spaces were generated based on physical environments which featured objects randomly placed in the robot's path. Three configuration spaces were chosen based on how densely populated the environment was with obstacles to present a range of environments in which to test the algorithm. Next, within each of these three environments, five sets of start and end points were generated randomly. The points were inspected to ensure that no invalid point configurations were present. The algorithm was then run 40 times on each point set, and with five point sets per environment and three environments, 600 trials were conducted.

Figure \ref{fig:result} shows a visualization of 40 trials conducted on five start\/end point sets on a populated configuration space. Note that each line in the visualization represents a full evolution cycle with a population of 75 individuals.
