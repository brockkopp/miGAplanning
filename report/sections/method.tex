The Genetic Algorithm (GA) formed the basis for the experiemnts. Significant effort was expended setting up the GA in advance of testing, since without a well structured algorithm, the testing was sure to show poor results. The GA was implemented on Matlab, using the built-in GA libraries in order to avoid unnecessary development. While the base functionality was used, there remained many design considerations.
