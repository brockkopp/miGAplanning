The Genetic Algorithm (GA) was the subject of the experiments. Significant effort was expended setting up the GA in advance of testing, since without a well-structured algorithm, the testing was sure to show poor results. The GA was implemented in MATLAB, using the built-in GA libraries in order to avoid unnecessary development. While the base functionality was used, there remained many design considerations.

\subsection{Criteria and Fitness}
The aim of the implementation was to produce a path which minimized obstacle collisions, length and jerk of the path represented by a polynomial function. The fitness of an individual was based on an equation considering these three criteria.

In order to detect obstacle collisions, the algorithm iterated along the path, and checked at each point to see if the path was inside an obstacle. The chromosome was penalized proportionally to the number of path units within an obstacle. Collisions resulted in high punishments to the fitness value of an individual. It was important to divert the path around a collision point, as a single collision in the final solution would render that entire path invalid.

Length was calculated based on the integral line length formula. The weight of the line length was set to a medium penalty (relative to collisions and jerk). This was done since it is more important to find a valid solution that does not collide with any obstacles, than find the shortest path between the two points.

Finally, the maximum jerk value of the line was found by iterating the length of the fourth derivative of the path equation and recording the maximum value of this derivative. The jerk weight was set to make reduction in the jerk as important as reduction in the path length.

\subsection{Configuration Space}
Commanding a robotic manipulator's position is complicated by the fact that it cannot be specified as X-Y-Z coordinates, but rather must be commanded using joint angles. This is not intuitive for a human, and many existing planning techniques function using the more human-oriented X-Y or X-Y-Z coordinate systems, forcing the human to then convert their solutions to a joint space solution. As such, the robot's workspace was converted into a Configuration Space to allow the genetic algorithm to work with joint angles. Figure \ref{fig:ws2cs} shows both the workspace and the configuration space for a 2-DOF robot in an arbitrary workspace. The robotic manipulator's two degrees of freedom are denoted by the blue and red lines (each DOF respectively). The allowable robot configurations are represented in the Configuration Space by white areas, and collisions are represented by black.

\end{figure}

In the configuration space, robot trajectories can be easily identified by either a human or a motion planning algorithm. This angle-angle plot can then be used to implement a polynomial trajectory, of which optimal coefficients can easily be solved using a Genetic Algorithm. The parameterized trajectory is denoted in Equation \ref{eq:polyTraj}.

\subsection{Population Initialization}

The population was randomly initialized with coefficient values in the range of -500 to 500. This range was imposed on the coefficients as it was found to provide a good compromise between promoting function variation while at the same time keeping it mitigated enough so that changes to coefficients each generation did not make too drastic a change to the shape of the path.

The population size was chosen to be 75, after research found that exiting solutions consistently used a population range of approximately 50-100 \cite{gulsen95}. This population number provides the necessary diversity in the population. Lower population values were found to converge to non-ideal solutions.

\subsection{Encoding}
The GA was developed using a linear encoding scheme, where a chromosome was defined to be an array of the polynomial function's coefficients (denoted as $\{P_0, \ldots, P_3\}$ in Equation \ref{eq:polyTraj}). Therefore, the GA would ultimately return the ideal set of coefficients for a function which would describe the optimal path for the robotic manipulator.

\subsection{Linear Constraints}
The path planning problem is a challenging optimization problem due to the various constraints involved. The goal is to generate a path that avoids all obstacles, as well as minimize the path length and minimize jerk. The problem is further constrained by the start and end points. The generated polynomial path must go through these desired start and end points.

To solve this constrained optimization problem, linear equality constraints are used. Linear equalities have the form:

\begin{equation}
A_{eq}x = b_{eq}
\end{equation}

Where x is a vector of the variables being optimized. For this project, the optimization variables are the coefficients of the polynomial.

For example, a second order polynomial $y = A + Bx + Cx^2$ through points $[2 , 4]$ and $[10 , 5]$ would have linear constraints of the form:
\begin{equation}
	\begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 10 & 10^2 \\
	1 & 2 & 2^2
	\end{bmatrix}
	\begin{bmatrix}
	A \\
	B \\
	C \\
	\end{bmatrix} =
	\begin{bmatrix}
	5 \\
	4 \\
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Selection}
A tournament selection method was used in this implementation to select chromosomes for cross-over. Two individuals were chosen for each tournament, allowing for an acceptable tradeoff between choosing a fit parent while promoting diversity in the offspring. This was one approach used to increase the diversity of the population when it was observed that the algorithm was getting stuck in invalid local minima.

\subsection{Reproduction and Mutation}
A heuristic reproduction method was used wherein the child is generated by taking the mean of the coefficients of the two parents, and then biased to resemble one of its parents. In this implementation, the child was biased 20\% towards the most fit parent using Formula \ref{crossoverEq}.

\begin{equation} \label{crossoverEq}
	child_i = parent_{i2} + 1.2 * (parent_{i1} - parent_{i2})
\end{equation}

As is common in non-binary encoded GA problems, the crossover method used in this implementation is based on a mean of the parents' genes. This is a key distinction from a traditional point crossover method, as it allows the genes to evolve from values that were not present in the initial population. If point crossover methods had been used, the best case scenario would simply involve the optimal configuration of coefficients from the initial, random population.

Mutation was achieved applying a random mutation to a coefficient within the individual selected to be mutated. In order to satisfy the linear constraints of the start and end points, if the function was rendered invalid by the mutation, a new random coefficient was chosen instead. The mutated coefficient must lie within the defined coefficient range of -500 to 500.

\subsection{Termination}
The termination criteria allow the GA to determine when it has reached the optimal solution to the problem. In this implementation, a termination criteria based on convergence of the fitness function was used. The mean fitness value over ten generations was averaged. When the averaged mean fitness value converged within 0.001 units, the algorithm was terminated. This is representative of a situation where the diversity of the function has been reduced, and the algorithm has converged on a minimum fitness value.

\subsection{Experiment} \label{sec:experiment}
In order to assess the performance of the GA approach, an extensive experiment was devised. The algorithm was run 600 times on 15 sets of randomly generated points in 3 environments (forming 45 different environments), with randomly positioned obstacles. Invalid combinations of point sets (such as a point which lies within an obstacle) were removed from the dataset and new points were randomly generated to replace them. The environments were chosen to represent environments which were sparsely populated with obstacles, through to dense population with obstacles. The results obtained by this experiment are presented Section \ref{sec:results}.
