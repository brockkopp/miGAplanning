Abstract (4 Senetences)
?1. State the problem
?2. Say why it’s an interesting problem
?3. Say what your solution achieves
?4. Say what follows from your solution

Introduction (1 Page)
1.Describe the problem
 - Use Examples
 - Present the general case
2.State your contributions
	-Present a list of contributions
	
Background (1 page)
?Materials & Method
?Datasets
?Materials (sources)
?Methods (reference and brief description)
?Proposed approach: algorithm
?Equations and formulas

Method (2-3 pages)

-Check that each claim in the intro is addressed
-Forward reference evidence from a claim
-Present the experiments
-Analyze raw data

Experiments -> focus on some of these concepts
1.Direct Assessment
?human judging/scoring performance (expert assessment)
?Many acceptable solutions and result not generate same solution
?Ex. Generating non-identical portfolio for investors
2.Ablation (Removal) and Substitution Studies
?Remove or replace components
?Ex. caching
3.Tuning studies
?Tuning to performance on a test data
?Warning: research deems as wasteful and misleading
4.Limitation studies
?Imperfect data (rearrangement, noisy, incomplete, incorrect)
?Restricted resource (computational time, available test data)
?Boundary test cases
5.Inductive studies
?Solve new and different problems

Results (2-3 Pages)
-Stats & Distributions
